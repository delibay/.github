### An open source learning platform based on deliberate practice principles for IT students and their teachers, focused on practice and feedback.

We are not hosting our code with GitHub for various reasons (mostly because GitHub is proprietary), but we use Gitea instead. You can find the source code and contribute to the project on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/delibay/)!

And can you learn more about the project on [delibay.org](https://delibay.org) !
